    <h3>FAQ</h3>
    <h4>1.) What is Viper ?</h4>
    <p>Viper is the start of an idea to create a simpler and efficient package manager</p>
    <h4>2.) Is there a need for another package manager?</h4>
    <p>We feel the biggest detterent to python is the difficuly for beginners in using currently available package managers. Most of them of require the creation of a virtualenv which we feel can waste a lot of space especially if you have lots of packges.
    <h4>3.) How can I contribute to the project ?</h4>
    <p>Development is on hold until PyPa has deemed this project worth the extra effort. This is due to the problem that Viper does not as of yet solve any new issues and only serves as an alternative solution. You can read the discussion that lead to this conclusion below <a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/daegontaven/eeda6870f131d161c7c0988f00955e7b/raw/95736f0cb24e65c6cdce3e841d5d61b40de54f77/viper-pypa-chat-01.txt">here<a/>.
